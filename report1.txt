Project Milestone

At this stage, I have written a basic Javascript program that interacts with the Supreme website. As per my project proposal, "My midterm milestone will be using Puppeteer or Selenium to interface with the Supreme website in some way". While this was an easier task than anticipated, it is probably fine because I've had a somewhat turbulent semester academically so I wasn't able to work on it as much as I hoped. Most of the time was spent doing research. First I had to learn a little about how headless web browsing works. It seems most people use it for web testing. Then I had to research different options for headless web browsing options. There were far more than I expected and I spent a while in a test directory trying out the different ones. I settled on Google Chrome's puppeteer because it seemed like most of the options would work fine so I just wanted one with good documentation and because I figured Google is reliable. Then I implemented a simple program using Puppeteer that goes to the Supreme website, loads the main page without any images or CSS (to reduce load time), and takes a screenshot. This all works great. The place I am currently stuck on is how to navigate to the particular item I want to purchase. Each item has a unique key which should be useful but the only place that key appears in the HTML is in the images alt attributes for each item image. There are no other things in the HTML that would make it possible to find the proper item. I think I should be able to finish this by the end of the term but I think the difficulty curve will increase steadily as I proceed.
